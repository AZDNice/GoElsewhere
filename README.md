# Go-Elsewhere

## A self-hosted URL-redirector (think [bit.ly](https://bit.ly))

_Note: There is still a lot of work to be done here. In it's current state, everything works, but is lacking key functionality._

This project started as me wanting to find a self hosted alternative to the PHP-backed [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/), which is very good... but doesn't feel overly modern. Origionally I was just going to stick to an API backend and call it a day, but this seemed like a nice introductory project to building a React-based front end. Start to finish, in it's base state, this project took about a week, meaning there is a lot to change, and the React is far from perfect (I'm definitely still learning).
